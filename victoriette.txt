VICTORIETTE on OKCUPID

My self-summary

Hi! I'm Victoriette. I'm funny, adventurous, joyful, and brainy. Many people come to OKCupid to meet nice, gentle people. Right now, I'm looking for something different: people who are spectacular.

This profile is an experiment, to find people who want to embark on something remarkable. People who are ridiculously interesting, intelligent, creative, or profoundly kinky. I'm looking for people with experience: let's get together and run as fast and smart and sensually as we can.

I'm the first to admit: this doesn't guarantee that we can make a relationship work. Perhaps it won't work out. That's OK. If you're willing to come and see if we click, we have the chance to make something meteoric together.

Here are some examples. If you are at least one of the following—or something similarly extraordinary—I'd like to hear from you.

- Do you have a lot of fetishes? Like, a lot. Do you need multiple drawers for equipment that you bought at Bunnings and re-purposed for sex? When you hear about a fetish for the first time, do you think, "I have to try it?"

- Are you extremely open-minded? Do you have a severe novelty preference? Do you actively push your boundaries, and step outside your own bubble? Can you name someone you respect with whom you disagree?

- Do you have creative projects that you're actively working on? Not projects sitting on the shelf—ones you work on regularly. I co-founded a hackerspace and I'm down for project afternoons.

- Do you think Dominance and submission don't really have anything to do with "being mean" and "being naughty"? Wouldn't you rather explore something deeper, and more profound? Where could we go, inside one another's minds?

- Are you actively working on improving your own communication? Are you reading about non-violent communication, CFAR, or even Dale Carnegie? Want a relationship based on open, honest, and evolving communication?

- Are you joyful? Are you always laughing and telling jokes? Do you think the correct response to a good pun is a high-five?

- Are you intensely curious? Do you have to know everything? When you're talking to someone online, and they reference something you don't know, do you look it up before asking, "What's that?"

- Do you think carefully about spelling, grammar, and language when you write to people? Think you're up to exchanging filthy and exquisitely written erotica?

- I have a very tender spot for people who crossdress, trans people, and people with autogynephilia. I have practical sexual experience with all three. Would you like to spend time with someone interested in seeing the real you?

Got the idea? If you're interested in meeting someone interesting, and you can bring it, send me a message introducing yourself.
