My self-summary

Please only contact me if you live in Melbourne, Australia.

Statler seeking Waldorf. Irene seeking Sherlock.
Amy seeking Tina. Princess Bubblegum seeking Marceline.

I'm the kind of girl who'll proposition strangers for a one-night conversation.

I like rapid-fire, provocative, labyrinthine conversations that run riot through the hoarded halls of history. I like conversations that burn down sacred propriety. I like people whose minds are dangerous and free.

I'm looking for people who can hold their own in a conversation that starts when we meet for drinks, and stampedes through dinner, dessert, coffee, empty streets, taxis, four o'clock in the morning wrapped in your sheets.

Be my partner in crime on adventures, grand gestures, and public acts of art.

I like adjectives, I do things for anecdote value, and I was raised by public service announcements.

What I’m doing with my life

I'm a professional writer and a maker, and I'm always running some sort of croquet tournament, or engineering collective, or dinner party, &c. I volunteer at a shelter for people who are homeless or disadvantaged. I try to see and make a lot of art.

But what I'm actually trying to _do_ with my life is to be love and compassion personified, and be very kind to everything, and tell jokes that make people burst into laughter. That's me.

I’m really good at

Storytelling: I'm an inveterate raconteur.

The first things people usually notice about me

I'm not shy, and I love to smile. I wear lots of interesting, chunky accessories. I have pale, creamy skin.

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food

The Awl. Scroobius Pip. Galavant. Primer.

On a typical Friday night I am

The Economist and chill.

The most private thing I’m willing to admit

I know I'm a bit overweight, but let's be honest. You'll want to sink your hands into my thighs like a baker into dough.

You should message me if

You are any two of: smart, funny, interesting, pretty.
